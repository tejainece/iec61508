+ IEC61508-4 3.5.1

# Safety integrity

Probability of a system performing the specified safety functions under all stated conditions within a stated period of time. It measures the reliability of the system to perform the [safety function](#safety-function).

All causes of failures (Random hardware failures and Systematic failures) that lead to an unsafe state shall be considered in determining safety integrity. For example:  
+ Hardware failures
+ Software induced failures
+ Failures due to electrical interferences

Safety integrity comprises of:
+ Software safety integrity
+ Systematic safety integrity
+ Hardware safety integrity
