This article documents the definition of different type of failures as documented in IEC61508-4 3.6.5:3.6.14.

# Random hardware failure

Failure occuring at a random time due to degradation mechanism in hardware. Usually, in a system, there are multiple degaradations occuring at different rates in different components. These degradations occur at *predictable rate but at unpredictable times*.

These failures cannot be fixed by changes to design since they are the unavoidable properties of the components of the system.

# Error

Discrepancy between a computed, observed or measure value and the correct, specified or theorectically correct value or condition.

# Soft error

Erroneous changes to data content without any changes to the physical circuit itself.

Following a soft error has occured, the circuit will be restored to its original state when the effected data is corrected.
